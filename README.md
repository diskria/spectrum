[![Inspired by Google Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/inspired%20by-Google%20Repo-blue)](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo)

A manifest repository that brings all projects together into a single AOSP-style tree.
Instead of managing repositories one by one, you can sync everything at once and always get a consistent project layout.

## Sync

Run this [one-liner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diskria/spectrum/main/sync.sh) to install `repo`, init the manifest and sync all repositories:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diskria/spectrum/main/sync.sh)
```

## Resulting structure

After syncing, youâ€™ll have a consistent project tree, for example:

```bash
workspace/
â”œâ”€ diskria/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ diskria/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ projektor/
â”‚  â””â”€ spectrum/
â”œâ”€ organizationA/
â”‚  â””â”€ project1/
â”œâ”€ organizationB/
â”‚  â””â”€ project2/
â””â”€ organizationC/
   â””â”€ project3/
```

## Why

* Keep all repositories under one roof
* Fixed and consistent paths across environments
* Simple local setup and navigation
* Perfect for cross-project development and quick context switching
